# tic-tac-toe

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndreaCrotti/tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AndreaCrotti/tic-tac-toe)

## Usage

    lein run -c CONFIG_FILE -p PROFILE

Where the default configuration is an
[this EDN file](resources/config.edn), and each profile configures
the initial player, the size of the board and the algorithm
which each player should use.

So for example to play a game with the profile `win-random`, which
makes `p1` use a `win` strategy, and `p2` uses a simple random
strategy, you can run:

    $ lein run -p win-random
    Winner:  :p1
    o _ x
    x o x
    o _ x

Which will show the player who won and what was the last board status.

## TODO

- [x] implement more strategies
    - [x] random algorithm
    - [x] blocker algorithm, simply try to block the opponent
    - [x] best move algorithm

- [ ] store game results with an in memory datascript database
- [ ] generate some interesting reports about the winner, using different strategies
- [ ] make the various algorithm compete against each other and see who the winner is
- [ ] implement a UI with re-frame to show the whole thing up and running
- [ ] add CLI interface reading from stdin
